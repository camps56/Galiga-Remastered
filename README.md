# Galiga-Remastered
The old Galiga remastered with more features
This is my first ever project so please any suggestions you have let me know, this will be slow progess as i'm also learning as I go and also trying to balance with my school work. I will be trying to update every monday with atleast 3 new features or bug fixes. In the projects tab should show each monday what features i'm trying to incorporate. 

This game will be on windows but primarily on Android, completely free, this is my first ever game so I know it's not going to be the greatest.
